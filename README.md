# arrowroadmarking
This code contains the implementation of the paper "Using Edit Distance and Junction Feature to Detect and Recognise Arrow Road Marking" by Yuhang He, Shi Chen et al., which is published on IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2014. 

The code has been successfully tested on Ubuntu/Mac OS. Moreover, it builds on C++/OpenCV, which means that you should install OpenCV in advance.

The code needs LSD for line segmentation, if you use our code, please also cite the LSD paper: 
Rafael Grompone von Gioi, Jérémie Jakubowicz, Jean-Michel Morel, and Gregory Randall, LSD: a Line Segment Detector, Image Processing On Line, 2 (2012), pp. 35–55.

There are many paramter to tune, so you might tune all parameter first to get fine result.

Please cide our paper if you use it for your own research purpose.
